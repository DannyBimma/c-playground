# C Playground

A collection of C programming exercises, experiments, and projects designed to explore the language from fundamentals to advanced concepts. What might appear as "ostensibly random" files actually represents a structured journey through C programming - from basic syntax to complex algorithms and real-world applications.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a learning laboratory for C programming, featuring:

- **Foundational exercises** that build core programming skills
- **Algorithm implementations** to understand computational complexity
- **CS50 problem sets** demonstrating academic computer science concepts
- **Personal projects** that apply C to solve real-world problems
- **Experimental code** for testing language features and techniques

The apparent randomness reflects the organic nature of learning - tackling problems as they arise, experimenting with different approaches, and building upon previous knowledge.

## Highlighted Programs

### Tideman Voting System

The Tideman algorithm (`cs50/cs50_tideman.c`) implements a sophisticated ranked-choice voting system that prevents vote splitting and ensures the most representative winner. This program showcases advanced data structures, graph theory concepts, and complex algorithmic thinking.

### Formula 1 Predictor

The Grand Prix predictor (`projects/grand_prixdictor.c`) combines multiple data sources to predict race outcomes, demonstrating real-world application of C programming to sports analytics. It features configurable parameters, probability modeling, and elegant result presentation.

### High-Performance Speller

The speller project (`projects/speller/`) implements a production-quality spell-checker with emphasis on performance optimisation, memory management, and scalability - essential skills for systems programming.

## Building and Running

Most programs can be compiled with standard GCC:

```bash
gcc -o program_name source_file.c
```

For the Grand Prix predictor:

```bash
make grand_prixdictor
./grand_prixdictor [track] [condition]
```

For CS50 programs that use the CS50 library:

```bash
gcc -lcs50 -o program_name source_file.c
```

## Learning Journey

This repository represents an iterative learning process where each program builds upon previous knowledge:

1. **Fundamentals** ‚Üí Basic syntax, variables, and control structures
2. **Memory Management** ‚Üí Pointers, dynamic allocation, and data structures
3. **Algorithms** ‚Üí Sorting, searching, and complexity analysis
4. **Real Applications** ‚Üí Text processing, data analysis, and predictive modeling
5. **Systems Programming** ‚Üí Performance optimisation and large-scale data handling

The "randomness" reflects the natural progression of a programmer exploring different domains and challenges, making this repository both a learning archive and a testament to the versatility of C programming.
