// So I tried to implement CS50's Mario on my own, on my machine.
// But apparently some things would need to be installed on my system?
// Long story short I am currently too stupid to get whatever the fuck
// installed so the code could compile and run.
// So instead, I just asked Claude to rewrite it for me without using
// the CS50 library so maybe i can look back on this code in 85 years 
// and actually what the actual fuck line 19 is doing ðŸ˜­!!
